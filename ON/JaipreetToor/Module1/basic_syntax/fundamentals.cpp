#include <iostream>  // iostream is the header file. Standard C++ library file
using namespace std; // to make it easier to reference operations.

// The main function of the program. The code inside {} is called the body and is executed first when you run the program
int main() {
    cout << "Comments";  // the standard outout stream 
    return 0;            // return statement. Not that important becuase the IDE will do it automatically
