1) It depends on what variable is used. If myStrArray is used then the char array is blank, and if myStrArray2 is used then it matches the string.

2) Yes because it allows the program to iterate over the characters until the end of the string

3) It doesnt remove the values already in myStr2, so myStr2 ends up being 2 different strings crammed together

4) Not sure
